Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey, you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

What you'll do and what you'll learn:
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.
Computer programming
Printing data
Paradigms
Introduction to Java
Basic literals
Overview of the basic program
Stage implementation
Introduce yourself to the bot.
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
